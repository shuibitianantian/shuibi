# Shuibi Prediction Project
This is the project to demonstrate one of my academic projects when I was study at Stevens Institute of Technology, the course code was BIA 656.

# Why this name?
This is the name that I used for my first character (`warlock`) that I created in World of Warcraft, the Chinese version is __`水笔`__, I love this name for no reason.


# Why is the purpose of this project?
In BIA 656, the instructor asked us to build a decision making tool to demostrate our project. Apparently, we did not do that. With more skills, I decided to fill that blank. And this project was a collaboration of 4 people, shout out Huijuan Yao, Zhen Ma, Dongkai Jiang and myself.

This project is only for demostrating purpose, and the prediction is simply a __`joke`__.
